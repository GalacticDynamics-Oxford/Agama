    \brief   Orbit integration
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2009-2021

    This module provides classes and routines for numerical computation of orbits in a given potential.
    This task is divided between three classes:
    - a general-purpose ODE integrator;
    - the function that provides the r.h.s. of the ODE (time derivatives of position and velocity 
    in a particular coordinate system) for the given potential, optionally with some figure rotation;
    - functions that perform useful data collection tasks on the orbit while it is being computed.

    The first part is implemented by one of the available methods from math_ode.h,
    and the instance of an appropriate class derived from `math::BaseOdeSolver` is
    constructed internally for each orbit.
    The second part is implemented by any class derived from `math::IOdeSystem`.
    The third part is realized through a generic system of 'runtime functions', which are attached
    to the orbit and called after each timestep of the ODE integrator, so that they can access
    the trajectory at any point within the current timestep (obtain the interpolated solution)
    and use it to collect and store any relevant data. For instance, the `orbit::RuntimeTrajectory`
    class stores the trajectory at regular intervals. These functions can also influence the
    orbit integration by rewriting the orbit state with the new position/velocity.
    To isolate the data collection from the implementation of the orbit integrator (in particular,
    the choice of its internal coordinate system), the runtime functions do not interact directly with
    the ODE solver, but rather with an interface provided by the class `orbit::BaseOrbitIntegrator`,
    which is the base class for the three variants of the class `orbit::OrbitIntegrator`
    for different coordinate systems. This class, and in particular it method `run()`,
    is the actual entry point for computing an orbit in the given potential, optionally rotating
    about the z axis with some pattern speed Omega, while any number of attached runtime functions
    performing data collection tasks. Another convenience function `orbit::integrateTraj()`
    performs a simplified task of just recording the trajectory.

/** Interface for the orbit integrator in the given potential, optionally in a reference frame
    rotating about the z axis with angular frequency Omega.
    This class serves as a bridge between the actual ODE integrator, which performs its job in
    some internal coordinate system, and the runtime functions, which retrieve or update 
    the position/velocity in cartesian coordinates.
    The actual implementations in different internal coordinate systems are provided by
    the derived classes OrbitIntegrator<CoordT>.
    The connection between the orbit integrator interface and the associated runtime functions is
    bi-directional: the integrator keeps track of the runtime functions attached to the given orbit,
    and each runtime function stores the reference to the orbit that it is attached to.
    Since the functions can change their internal state during orbit integration, and also may
    change the state of the orbit itself (its current 6d phase-space coordinates), these pointers
    and references are non-const, as well as the relevant methods of both class interfaces.
    The workflow for orbit computation is the following:
    1) Construct the orbit integrator instance.
    2) Optionally create some runtime functions and add them to the list of functions associated
    with the integrator object with the `addRuntimeFnc()` method;
    it is the responsibility of the caller to provide the reference to the same integrator object
    to the constructor of each runtime function (otherwise the workflow will be disrupted).
    3) Set up orbit initial conditions and time by calling `init()` method of the integrator.
    4) Evolve the orbit for the desired amount of time by calling `run()` method of the integrator.
    It will perform zero or more steps of the internal ODE solver, and call each runtime function's
    `processTimestep()` method after each completed timestep. These methods may, in turn, change
    the current state of the orbit by calling the `init()` method of the integrator.
    The `run()` method of a given orbit instance may be called more than once; the orbit state
    is preserved between runs, unless reset by `init()`, but this should be used only to continue
    the integration of the same orbit, not to start a new one (there is no mechanism to inform
    the runtime functions that a new orbit is now computed - they are single-use objects).
    5) The runtime functions may perform some finalization tasks once the orbit is completed,
    but they would not know that this is the case until their destructor is called.
    So the standard approach should be to construct the orbit integrator in a nested scope block,
    populate it with newly constructed runtime functions that do not have any external references,
    run the orbit, and then close the nested scope block to ensure correct finalization.

/** The class that performs the actual orbit integration in the given coordinate system.
    It implements the IOdeSystem interface for the ODE integrator, providing the RHS of
    the differential equation, i.e., the derivatives of position and velocity
    in the internal coordinate system, optionally taking into account
    rotation about the z axis with a constant pattern speed Omega.
    Note that the choice of coordinate system is an internal implementation detail,
    and does not affect the way the initial conditions are fed in or the orbit is presented
    to the outside world, which is always in cartesian coordinates.
    The conversion between the internal representation and the externally accessible cartesian
    phase-space point is performed by `init()` and `getSol()` methods.
    In the case of a nonzero rotation frequency Omega, the position is given in the rotating
    frame, and the momentum (velocity) corresponds to the inertial frame that instantaneously
    coincides with the rotating frame. For instance, if the potential is z-axisymmetric,
    pattern rotation has no effect on the actual shape of the orbit, and numerically identical
    initial conditions would result in physically the same orbit regardless of Omega,
    but the recorded trajectory will read differently.
    \tparam  CoordT  is the type of coordinate system (Car, Cyl or Sph).
