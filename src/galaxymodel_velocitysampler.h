    \brief   Velocity assignment using Jeans or Eddington models
    \date    2010-2017
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev

    This module presents several routines for assigning velocities to particles.
    The main application is to construct suitable initial conditions for the orbit library
    in the context of Schwarzschild models. To this end, first the positions are drawn from
    the target density model, e.g., using the `generateDensitySamples()` routine, and then
    a reasonable velocity is assigned to each point, based on either of the three methods:

    - Eddington formula for the isotropic distribution function in a spherical model;
    - spherical Jeans equation for the radial and tangential velocity dispersion;
    - axisymmetric Jeans equation for three components of <v_j^2>, j=R,z,phi.

    Three separate routines implement these tasks for each method; they all follow a similar
    convention: take the array of particle coordinates, the potential, and an appropriate
    velocity generating interface, and return an array of positions+velocities.
    Another routine `assignVelocity()` presents a higher-level interface that automatically
    chooses between the three methods based on the provided arguments, and constructs
    the respective velocity generators internally.

/** A driver routine that assigns the particle velocities using one of the three methods,
    depending on input arguments.
    If neither beta nor kappa are provided, this implies the Eddington method (isotropic velocity
    drawn from a distribution function that is constructed for sphericalized versions of the input
    density and potential models).
    If beta is provided but kappa is not, this implies the spherical Jeans method
    with constant velocity anisotropy given by beta.
    If both beta and kappa are given, this means the axisymmetric Jeans method,
    with beta specifying the meridional velocity anisotropy and kappa - the amount of rotation.
    \param[in]  pointCoords  is the array of particle positions and masses;
    usually they would be drawn from the same density model as provided in the `dens` argument,
    for instance, using the `generateDensitySamples()` routine, but this is not necessary.
    \param[in]  dens  is the input density model (if it is not spherical or axisymmetric,
    an appropriately symmetrized version will be constructed internally).
    \param[in]  pot  is the total gravitational potential (may have any geometry);
    assigned velocities will not exceed the local escape velocity at any point.
    \param[in]  beta  is the velocity anisotropy coefficient for Jeans models.
    Its meaning is different for spherical or axisymmetric models: in the first case,
    beta = 1 - sigma_t^2 / (2 sigma_r^2), and in the second case, beta = 1 - sigma_z^2 / sigma_R^2.
    \param[in]  kappa  is the amount of rotation in axisymmetric Jeans models
    (0 means no net rotation, 1 is close to maximum - gives sigma_R = sigma_phi).
    \return  the array of particle positions, velocities and masses.
    \throw  std::runtime_error or any other exception in case of problems.
