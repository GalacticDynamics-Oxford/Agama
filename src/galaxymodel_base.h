/** Compute the value of 'projected distribution function' at the given point
    specified by two coordinates in the sky plane (X,Y) and possibly some velocity components.
    The DF is integrated along the line of sight (Z) and all three velocity components -
    either across the entire range of available velocity, or over the Gaussian uncertainties.
    The orientation of the 'observational' coordinate system XYZ with respect to the 'intrinsic'
    coordinate system xyz of the model is specified by three Euler angles alpha, beta, gamma.
    The input point has precisely known X,Y coordinates, unknown Z (i.e. the DF is integrated over Z),
    and three velocity components vX,vY,vZ that may be known precisely, imprecisely (with some
    uncertainty), or not at all (with infinite uncertainty).
    When a given velocity component is not known precisely, the DF is integrated over the
    available range of this component, weighted with the Gaussian the measurement uncertainty
    (unless it is infinite, in which case the weight factor is identically unity).
    Thus the uncertainties on each velocity component can be anywhere between 0 and INFINITY
    (including endpoints), with the only restriction that vX,vY uncertainties can be either
    both finite or both infinite.
    Note that in the case of a finite but relatively very large uncertainty compared to the
    available range of velocities in the model, the result is almost identical to the case
    of infinite uncertainty, but differs in normalization:  e.g., when vZ_error >> vZ,
    projectedDF(..., vZ, vZ_error) =
    projectedDF(...,  0, INFINITY) * exp(-0.5 * (vZ/vZ_error)^2) / sqrt(2*pi) / vZ_error.
    When all three velocity uncertainties are infinite, the result is the surface density.
    \param[in]  model  is the galaxy model.
    \param[in]  point  specifies the two coordinates in the 'observed' coordinate system.
    \param[in]  vel  are the three velocity components in the 'observed' coordinate system.
    \param[in]  velerr  are their respective uncertainties;
    note that if the uncertainty is INFINITY, the corresponding velocity value is irrelevant.
    \param[out] result  will contain the values of projected DF (a single value if separate==false,
    otherwise an array of length df.numValues() - should be allocated by the caller).
    \param[in]  separate    whether to compute moments separately for each element of
    a multicomponent DF; in this case, the result array should have length equal to df.numValues().
    \param[in]  orientation  is the triplet of Euler angles specifying the orientation of
    the 'observed' coordinate system with respect to 'intrinsic' model coordinates;
    in particular, beta is the inclination angle, and alpha is irrelevant for axisymmetric systems.
    \param[in]  reqRelError is the required relative error in the integral.
    \param[in]  maxNumEval  is the maximum number of evaluations in integral.
    \throws  std::invalid_argument  if the combination of velocity uncertainties is unsupported,
    or any exception that occurs during the integration.

/** Compute the velocity distribution functions (VDF) in three directions at the given point in space.
    The input point and the orthogonal velocity axes are specified in the 'observed' Cartesian
    coordinate system XYZ, which may be arbitrarily oriented with respect to the 'intrinsic'
    coordinate system xyz of the model.
    The VDF is represented as a weighted sum of B-splines of degree N:
    0 means histogramming, 1 - linear interpolation, 3 - cubic interpolation.
    Higher degrees not only result in a smoother VDF, but also are easier to compute:
    the integration over the velocity space is carried out for all B-splines simultaneously,
    and the smoother are the basis functions, the easier is it for the quadrature to achieve
    the target level of accuracy.
    \tparam     N is the degree of B-splines (0, 1 or 3).
    \param[in]  model  is the galaxy model.
    \param[in]  point  is the position at which the VDF are computed.
    \param[in]  projected  determines whether to integrate over Z:
    if true, then only two coordinates (X,Y) of the input point is used, and the VDF is averaged
    over Z (i.e., represents the distribution of line-of-sight velocities and proper motions),
    otherwise the VDF is computed for the given 3d point.
    \param[in]  gridvX  is the array of grid nodes for the v_X velocity component,
    which define the set of basis functions for interpolation.
    The nodes must be sorted in increasing order, and typically should range from -V_escape to V_escape.
    A convenience overloaded version of this routine creates a suitable grid automatically.
    \param[in]  gridvY  is the same thing for the VDF of v_Y.
    \param[in]  gridvZ  is the same thing for v_Z (the line-of-sight component).
    \param[out] density  will contain the density at the given point XYZ (if projected==false)
    or the surface density at the point XY (if projected==true): it is used to normalize the
    amplitudes of the interpolator, and comes for free during integration anyway.
    If the flag separate==false, this will be a single value, otherwise an array of densities of
    each element of a multicomponent DF (should be allocated by the caller); same convention is
    used for other output arrays.
    \param[out] amplvX  should point to a vector (if separate==false) or an array of df.numValues()
    vectors (if separate==true), which will be filled with amplitudes for constructing an interpolated
    VDF for the v_X component, namely:
    ~~~~
    math::BsplineInterpolator1d<N> interp(gridvX);
    double f_of_v = interp.interpolate(v, amplvX);  // amplvX was obtained from this routine
    ~~~~
    The number of elements in amplvX is gridvX.size() + N - 1;
    for N=0 they are essentially the heights of the histogram bars between gridvX[i] and gridvX[i+1],
    and for N=1 the values of amplvX at each node of gridvX coincide with the interpolated f(v);
    however for higher N the correspondence is not so obvious.
    The VDF is normalized such that \f$  \int_{-V_{escape}}^{V_{escape}} f(v) dv = 1  \f$
    (if the provided interval specified by gridvX is smaller than V_escape, the integral
    over the extend ot gridvX will be smaller than unity).
    \param[out] amplvY  will contain the amplitudes for the v_Y component.
    \param[out] amplvZ  will contain the amplitudes for the v_Z component.
    \param[in]  separate    whether to compute moments separately for each element of
    a multicomponent DF; in this case, the output arrays should have length equal to df.numValues().
    \param[in]  orientation specifies the orientation of the observed coordinate system XYZ
    with respect to the intrinsic system xyz of the model, parametrized by three Euler angles;
    the default zero values of these angles make XYZ coincide with xyz.
    \param[in]  reqRelError is the required relative error in the integrals.
    \param[in]  maxNumEval  is the maximum number of evaluations for all integral together.
    \throw  std::invalid_argument if the input arrays are incorrect.
