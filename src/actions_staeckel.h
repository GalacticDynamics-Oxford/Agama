    \brief   Action-angle finders using Staeckel potential approximation
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2015

Computation of actions and angles for axisymmetric systems, using two related methods:
1) exact expressions for Staeckel potentials  (e.g. for the Perfect Ellipsoid),
2) "Staeckel Fudge" approximation applicable for any axisymmetric potential.
To avoid confusion, the latter is called simply "Fudge" in what follows.

Most sub-steps are shared between the two methods; 
only the computation of integrals of motion, and the auxiliary function that enters 
the expression for canonical momentum, are specific to each method.

The implementation is inspired by the code written by Jason Sanders,
but virtually nothing of the original code remains.

/** Action/angle finder for a generic axisymmetric potential, based on Staeckel Fudge approximation.
    It is more suitable for massive computation in a fixed potential than just using 
    the standalone routines, because it estimates the focal distance using a pre-computed 
    interpolation grid, rather than doing it individually for each point. This results in 
    a considerable speedup in action computation, for a minor overhead during initialization.
    Additionally, it may set up an interpolation table for actions as functions of three integrals
    of motion (one of them being approximate), which speeds up the evaluation by another order of
    magnitude, for a moderate decrease in accuracy. Interpolated actions have small but non-negligible
    systematic bias, which depends on the potential as well as the phase-space location,
    hence they cannot be used for comparing the likelihood of a DF in different potentials.
