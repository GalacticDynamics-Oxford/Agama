/** A Target object represents any possible constraint in the model.
    These could come from the self-consistency requirements for the density/potential pair,
    or from various kinematic requirements, velocity profiles, etc.
    A target consists of an array of required values for the constraints,
    an array of penalties for their violation (often related to measurement errors),
    and two methods for computing these constraints for a given galaxy model.
    The first one deals with orbit-based models, and returns an orbit runtime function
    that computes the values of these constraints for each orbit as it is being integrated.
    The second one deals with models based on a single- or multicomponent distribution function,
    and returns an array of values for each component of the DF.
