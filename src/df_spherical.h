/** A wrapper class for representing an arbitrary spherical isotropic distribution function,
    originally expressed in terms of phase volume `h`, as a regular action-based DF.
    The phase volume `h` in a spherically-symmetric potential is uniquely related to energy,
    and plays the same role as actions in a more general geometry: it is an adiabatic invariant,
    f(h) dh is the mass in the given volume of phase space regardless of the potential,
    and f(h) has the same expression in any potential.
    In order to put these models on the common ground with other action-based DFs,
    we express them in terms of actions, by using two successive mappings:
    (Jr, Jz+|Jphi|) => E  is provided by a spherical action mapper;
    E => h(E)  is provided by the PhaseVolume class,
    and finally h is used as the argument of DF.
    Both these auxiliary transformations are constructed for a given spherically-symmetric
    potential, but then the resulting DF can be viewed as a function of actions only,
    and used in an arbitrary potential just as any other f(J); the intermediate mappings
    become part of its definition. Of course, it may no longer yield isotropic velocity
    distributions -- hence the name 'quasi'.
    If one needs to construct a spherical isotropic DF for a particular potential-density pair
    using the Eddington formula, it is better to use the class `QuasiSphericalCOM`, which performs
    both tasks (constructing the DF and computing its value as a function of actions) with lower
    overhead costs (it only performs the conversion J => E, but not E => h).
    On the other hand, this wrapper class should be used if one already has a DF in the form f(h).

/** Parent class for spherical (an)isotropic distribution functions expressed in terms of E,L,Lz.
    These functions are constructed for a given potential-density pair using a suitable inversion
    formula (e.g., Eddington in the isotropic case), and provide two interfaces for computing the
    DF value.
    The 'classical' form `f.value(E,L,Lz)` can only be used in the same potential Phi
    that was used in constructing the DF, but incurs no extra costs.
    The 'universal' action-based form `f.value(J)` can be used in any potential Phi_1,
    and works as follows: first the actions are converted to the triplet E,L,Lz using the
    spherical action finder created together with the DF in the original potential Phi,
    and then the DF value at these arguments is returned. In essense, this assumes that the DF
    was adiabatically transformed into the new potential, keeping its numerical value as a function
    of actions (hence the original potential is used in this context).
    The second form obviously involves extra costs associated with the transformation J => E,
    but allows this DF to be used in the general routines for computing moments, sampling, etc.
    In the future, optimized code paths for this subtype of DFs may be implemented in these routines.
    If the potential Phi_1 is not spherical, the DF will also produce a non-spherical and possibly
    anisotropic density and velocity dispersion profile (even if it was originally isotropic),
    hence the name 'quasi'.
    The descendant classes implement the specific way of constructing a DF and compute its value
    as a function of E,L,Lz.
