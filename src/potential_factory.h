    \brief   Creation and input/output of Potential instances

    \date    2010-2022

    This file provides several utility function to manage instances of BaseDensity and BasePotential:
    creating a density or potential model from parameters provided in `utils::KeyValueMap` objects,
    creating a potential from a set of point masses or from an N-body snapshot file,
    loading and storing density/potential coefficients in text files.
