    \brief   Loss-cone treatment (part of the Raga code)
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2013-2017

    This module deals with captures of stars by the central supermassive black hole(s).

    A particle is considered to be captured or tidally disrupted if it approaches to within
    the given distance (loss-cone radius) from the black hole, while passing the pericenter
    of its orbit. Such particle is excluded from subsequent evolution, its orbit integration
    is terminated for the current episode, and its mass is set to zero at the end of
    the episode, rendering it an inactive particle. The mass of the captured particles,
    or a given fraction of it, is then added to the mass of the black hole at the end of
    the episode. If there is a binary black hole, each component may capture stars within
    its own loss-cone radius. In this case, captured particles do not contribute
    to the binary hardening, since their evolution terminates at the moment of capture.
    Since it may happen that a star passes the pericenter during the current timestep,
    and is outside the capture radius both at the beginning and the end of timestep,
    but still briefly plunges inside this radius in between, we determine the exact
    time of pericenter passage and the distance r from the black hole at this time,
    by locating the root of dr(t)/dt=0 when it changes from negative to positive
    within the current timestep. In case of two black holes, the distance to each one
    is tracked separately.

/** The driver class implementing the capture of particles by the central supermassive black hole(s).
    The parameters of the black hole(s) are stored in the external BHParams variable,
    and a non-const reference to it is used to update the masses of the black holes
    at the end of the episode, if any particles were captured.
    A non-const reference to the array of particles is used to set the masses of captured particles
    to zero, which excludes them from the subsequent evolution (their positions remain frozen at
    the moment of capture).
    The list of captured particles, sorted by the capture time, is written to a text file.
