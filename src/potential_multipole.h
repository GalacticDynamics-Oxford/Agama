    \brief   density and potential approximations based on spherical-harmonic expansion
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2010-2023

    This module provides tools for representing arbitrary density and potential profiles
    in terms of spherical-harmonic (or multipole) expansion, with coefficients being
    interpolated in radius, and a related class for representing the potential in terms
    of a basis-set expansion (still spherical-harmonic in angles, but with a separate
    set of basis functions for the radial part).

    Mathematical background for spherical-harmonic transformation is provided in
    math_sphharm.h; in brief, the transformation is defined by two order parameters --
    lmax is the maximum index of Legendre polynomials in cos(theta), and mmax<=lmax is
    the maximum index of Fourier harmonics in phi. The choice of terms to be used in
    the expansion depends on symmetry properties of the model; for instance,
    in the triaxial case only terms with even and non-negative l,m are involved,
    and in the axisymmetric case only m=0 terms are non-zero.

    The density approximation uses cubic splines in log(r) for each sph.-harm. term,
    with power-law extrapolation to small and large radii.

    The potential approximation (Multipole) uses quintic splines in log(r), defined
    by their values and derivatives at grid nodes. Depending on the order of expansion,
    it employs either 1d splines for each term, or 2d splines in the (r,theta) plane
    for each azimuthal (m) Fourier harmonic, whichever is more efficient.
    In the second case, it is similar to CylSpline expansion, but the latter uses
    2d splines in scaled (R,z) coordinates for each m.
    Additionally, scaling transformations of coordinates and amplitudes are used
    to improve the accuracy of interpolation.
    The approximation is fairly accurate even with a rather sparse grid spacing:
    for instance, a grid with 20 nodes may cover a radial range spanning 6 orders
    of magnitude and still provide a good accuracy.
    Extrapolation of potential to small and large r (beyond the extent of the grid)
    is based on asymptotic power-law scaling of multipole coefficients, thus the density
    profile is generally well approximated even outside the grid.
    This asymptotic power-law extrapolation is also used in CylSpline.

    The potential expansion may be computed either from an existing potential
    (providing a computationally efficient approximation to a possibly expensive
    potential), from a density profile (thus solving the Poisson equation in spherical
    harmonics), or from an array of point masses (again solving the Poisson equation).
    Once constructed, the coefficients of expansion can be stored to and subsequently
    loaded from a text file, using routines `readPotential/writePotential` in
    potential_factory.h

    Each term with index {l,m} is given by
