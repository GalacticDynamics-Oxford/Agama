    \brief   Binary supermassive black hole evolution (part of the Raga code)
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2015-2017

    This module implements the evolution of a binary supermassive black hole
    sitting at the center of the stellar system.

    The binary is assumed to be 'hard', i.e. its components move on a Keplerian orbit around
    the common center of mass, which itself is pinned down at origin.
    Furthermore its orbit lies in the x-y plane and is elongated in the x direction.
    The particles of the N-body system move in the time-dependent potential of this binary,
    and as a result, they gain or lose energy and angular momentum; by conservation laws,
    this should result in corresponding changes in the orbital parameters of the binary.
    The assumption is that they change very slowly, so these parameters are fixed
    during each episode, and updated at the end of an episode, using the accumulated
    changes in energy and angular momentum of all relevant particles during this episode.
    An 'encounter' is recorded when a particle approaches to within a given distance
    from the binary. The difference between energy and momentum of a particle
    at the beginning and the end of an encounter is recorded in a `BinaryEncounterData'
    structure; and the sequence of encounters for each particle during the current episode
    is then used to modify the parameters of the binary at the finalization stage.
    If the potential is non-axisymmetric, the change in angular momentum arising from
    the torque due to the stellar potential is subtracted from the overall change recorded
    during the encounter.
    Additionally, the binary black hole may shrink due to the emission of gravitational waves.
    This is also taken into account when adjusting its parameters at the end of an episode.
    The binary orbit parameters (semimajor axis and eccentricity) are written to a text file
    after each episode.
