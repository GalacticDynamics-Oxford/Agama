    \brief   Recomputation of gravitational potential (part of the Raga code)
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2013-2017

    This module handles the evolution of stellar gravitational potential during the simulation.

    The total potential is composed of the smooth (mean-field) potential of the stellar system,
    plus optionally the potential of the central massive black hole (or a BH binary).
    The stellar potential is created by particles, and is assumed to evolve only slowly
    (on a timescale much longer than the duration of a single episode), thus it remains fixed
    throughout the episode (hence all particles move in a common global potential independently,
    and do not directly interact with each other).
    This potential is represented by a spherical-harmonic expansion, implemented in the Multipole
    class of the Agama library. One may adjust the resolution of the radial grid and the angular
    order of this expansion, and in particular force a certain degree of symmetry.
    At the beginning of the simulation, the potential is computed from the initial positions
    of all particles, which is performed by the RagaCore class in the main module.
    The present module serves the purpose of recomputing the potential throughout the simulation
    (at the end of each episode); this may be turned off in the global settings, in which case
    the instance of RagaTaskPotential is not created).
    To reduce the impact of discreteness noise, the potential is constructed not only from
    the positions of particles at the end of the episode, but taking into account their
    entire trajectories during the episode (in other words, taking more than one sub-sample
    from each orbit, although one is also possible). The RuntimePotential class is responsible
    for storing these samples at regular intervals during the orbit integration in the global
    array variable which belongs to the RagaTaskPotential class. The latter class performs
    re-computation of the potential at the end of the episode, and optionally stores
    the potential expansion coefficients into a text file at pre-defined intervals of time
    (should be an integer number of episodes).
