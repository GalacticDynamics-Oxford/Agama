    \brief   Spherically-symmetric isotropic models
    \date    2010-2017
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev

    This module deals with isotropic distribution functions for spherical systems.
    They are traditionally expressed as functions of energy f(E), but it appears that
    another quantity -- the phase volume h -- is better suited as the argument of f.
    Phase volume h(E) is defined as the volume of the region {x,v} phase space where 
    Phi(x) + (1/2) v^2 <= E. In spherical symmetry, it is computed as
    \f[
    h(E) = \int_0^{r_{max}(E)} 4\pi r^2 dr \int_0^{v_{max}(E,r)} 4\pi v^2 dv =
    (16/3) \pi^2 \int_0^{r_{max}(E)} r^2 [2(E-\Phi(r))]^{3/2} ,
    \f]
    with E=Phi(r_max).
    The derivative dh(E)/dE = g(E) is called the density of states.
    The distribution function formulated in terms of h has the advantage that
    the mass per unit interval of h is given simply by  dM = f(h) dh,
    whereas in terms of E it is given by the familiar expression dM = f(E) g(E) dE.
    Moreover, an adiabatic modification of potential leaves f(h) unchanged,
    although the mapping h(E), of course, depends on the potential.

    The class `potential::PhaseVolume`, defined in potential_utils.h, establishes
    the bi-directional correspondence between E and h for any potential.
    Any function of a single variable may serve as a distribution function f(h);
    the class `math::LogLogSpline` can be used for representing a log-scaled interpolated f.
    The routines `df::createSphericalIsotropicDF` and `df::fitSphericalIsotropicDF`,
    defined in df_spherical.h, construct such interpolators from a pair of density and
    potential models (using the Eddington inversion formula) or from an array of particles
    with given masses and values of h (using penalized spline log-density fit).
    The classes `SphericalIsotropicModel` and `SphericalIsotropicModelLocal`, defined in
    this file, construct interpolation tables to provide coefficients of drift and diffusion
    describing the two-body relaxation process (the former - for the 1d orbit-averaged
    Fokker-Planck equation, the latter - for position-dependent relaxation coefficients
    as functions of r and v).
    These models are used in the galaxymodel_fokkerplanck module (the FP code PhaseFlow)
    and in the raga_*** modules (the Monte Carlo stellar-dynamical code Raga).

/** A combination of a spherical isotropic DF f(h) with a spherical potential.
    The DF is given by an arbitrary function (typically a LogLogSpline) of one argument
    (the phase volume h), and the potential is implicitly given by the mapping between Phi and h,
    represented by the `potential::PhaseVolume` class.
    This class constructs interpolators for various dynamical quantities (I_0, K_g, K_h)
    that enter the expressions for two-body relaxation coefficients.
    It is designed to work with multi-component models, in which the total DF is a sum of
    one or more species with different DFs f_i and stellar masses m_i.
    The diffusion coefficients are proportional to the sum of stellar mass-weighted DFs,
    while the advection coefficients also (or exclusively) contain the sum of unweighted DFs.
    Accordingly, this class makes a distinction between
    the unweighted df, denoted by lowercase  f = sum_i f_i,
    and the stellar mass-weighted DF, denoted by uppercase  F = sum_i m_i f_i.
    In a single-component system, these are identical up to a constant factor m_i.
    As a reminder, the normalization of the (unweighted) df is the total mass of the component.
