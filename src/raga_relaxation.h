    \brief   Simulate the effect of two-body relaxation (part of the Raga code)

    This module simulates the effect of two-body (collisional) relaxation,
    i.e., is the main component of the Monte Carlo approach to stellar dynamics.

    We use the Spitzer's approach to model the two-body relaxation:
    as independent and uncorrelated velocity perturbations applied to each particle
    while it moves in the global smooth potential. These perturbations are described
    by the classical expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients for velocity
    (dating back to Chandrasekhar's work). The functional form of these coefficients
    is determined by the distribution function of 'background' stars (scatterers),
    which in the present implementation are identified with the actual particles
    in the simulation. On the other hand, the amplitude of the coefficients is a free
    parameter, which is related to the number of stars in the physical system that is
    being modelled. For instance, we may represent a nuclear star cluster having 10^8
    stars with an N-body system having only 10^6 particles, but set the level of
    relaxation equal to that of the target physical system, and recover the correct
    evolution timescale. Of course, this does not take into account other numerical
    perturbations, mainly arising due to discreteness noise during the recomputation
    of potential and distribution function at the end of each episode; this introduces
    a practical limit on the lowest possible relaxation level that can be simulated
    reliably, in fact roughly two orders of magnitude below the inherent two-body
    relaxation level of a conventional N-body system with the same number of particles
    (hence the choice of the parameters in the above example). On the other hand,
    in physical systems with that many stars the collisional relaxation is typically
    unimportant, so that the Monte Carlo method bridges the gap between collisional
    and nearly collisionless systems in a reliable way.

    The computation of diffusion coefficients starts from the construction of
    the distribution function (DF) of stars, which is assumed to be isotropic
    (depends only on energy, or equivalently on the phase volume h, which is
    a monotonic function of energy in any spherically-symmetric potential).
    Of course, the actual N-body system may be non-spherical and non-isotropic;
    the motivation for this approximation, apart from computational simplification,
    is that the diffusion coefficients are integrals over the DF, so that details
    shouldn't matter.

    Thus within this module, the stellar system is represented in two complementary
    ways: with the actual non-spherical potential, and its sphericalized version
    that determines the correspondence between energy and phase volume, and ultimately
    the diffusion coefficients.
    The runtime function performs two independent tasks:
    - adds perturbations to the particle velocity after each timestep, which depend
    on the potential and kinetic energy through the model for diffusion coefficients.
    - collects samples of particle energy (or, rather, phase volume h(E)) at regular
    intervals of time during the episode, which are used to recompute the DF and
    the diffusion model at the end of episode. This is analogous to the way that
    the trajectory samples are collected for recomputing the density and hence
    the potential (in raga_potential.cpp), and for the same reason of reducing
    discreteness noise, we may take more than one sample per particle during each
    episode. Note that the potential and the DF are updated independently --
    in fact, either of them may be turned off, but if the relaxation rate is non-zero,
    then the DF must be updated to ensure the (approximate) energy conservation.

    The collected samples are used to recompute the DF f(h) at the end of each episode,
    and at the beginning of the first one (in this case only the instantaneous values
    of particle energies in the initial snapshot are used).
    Note that particles with positive energy cannot contribute to the DF
    by construction (they have infinite phase volume), but in practice their number
    shouldn't be significant.
    The relaxation model (radial dependence of various quantities -- spherical
    potential, density, DF, etc.) may be written to a text file at regular intervals
    of time (an integer multiple of episode length).
