This program is an example of running observationally-constrained Schwarzschild models
(the FORSTAND code, Vasiliev&Valluri 2020).
It has several modes of operation:

1.  Run a model for a particular choice of parameters for the potential, orbit library, etc.
    (actually, a series of models with the same potential/orbit, but different mass-to-light ratios,
    in which the velocities are rescaled before fitting to observational constraints).
    Normally one would launch several copies of the script with different parameters (e.g. Mbh),
    the results will be collected in a summary text file,
    and each model's best-fit LOSVD and orbit library will be stored in separate files.

2.  Display an interactive plot with several panels:
  - kinematic maps (v,sigma,Gauss-Hermite moments) of the data or the model(s),
    one may click on any aperture and examine the LOSVD profile in both the data and the current model;
  - a 2d plot of chi2 values as a function of potential parameters for a grid of models,
    one may choose a model from the grid, load its LOSVD and display corresponding kinematic maps;
  - LOSVD in the given aperture (both data constraints with uncertainties and the current model);
  - distribution of orbit weights of the current model in two projections of integral space:
    mean radius vs. normalized squared total angular momentum [L/Lcirc(E)]^2, or
    mean radius vs. orbit inclination Lz/L; the size of symbols indicates orbit weights.

3.  Prepare mock data for running the first two tasks.
    For this, one needs an N-body snapshot - in this example it should be produced by running
    a separate script  example_self_consistent_model3.py, which creates a three-component galaxy model
    (disk + bulge + DM halo) with a central black hole.
    It should be straightforward to feed in any other N-body snapshot, adjusting a few parameters.

This script uses various routines from the submodule agama.schwarzlib, which are general enough
to be used in any model fitting task. The specifics of each particular galaxy are encoded as numerous
parameters scattered througout this file.
Almost all needed parameters have reasonable default values in this example, but of course these are
not necessarily optimal for other purposes.
When adapting this example to your particular dataset, you will need to modify/adjust many parameters;
those which likely need to be changed are marked by [REQ],
other parameters which may be adjusted but have reasonable default values are marked by [OPT].
It is convenient to assign default values at the beginning of the script, and optionally change
some of them by providing command-line arguments in the form  name=value.

To run a complete example of constructing a grid of Schwarzschild models, do the following:

1.  Construct an N-body snapshot which will be used for the mock data, by running
    example_self_consistent_model3.py
    Among other things, it will produce the two files model_disk_final, model_bulge_final,
    which together contain the stellar particles of the model galaxy.

2.  Prepare the mock photometric and kinematic datasets, by running
    example_forstand.py do=mock
    It requires two Python modules 'mgefit' and 'vorbin'.
    This will produce an MGE file with surface density, and two kinematic datasets
    (low-resolution covering a large part of the galaxy, and high-res for the central region).
    Kinematic data (LOSVDs) in ~200 Voronoi bins are provided in two alternative forms:
  - histogrammed LOSVDs with values and their uncertainties in ~15 bins across the velocity axis;
  - Gauss-Hermite moments of LOSVDs (v, sigma, h3, h4, h5, h6 and their uncertainties).
    The models could be run on either of these alternative datasets, the choice is controlled
    by the command-line argument  hist=[y/n]  (the mock data are always generated for both cases).

3.  Now run several series of models with different values of Mbh:
    example_forstand.py do=run Mbh=...
    (of course, one may also adjust many other parameters, including hist=[true/false])
    Each series of models has the same gravitational potential, scaled by several values of M/L;
    the LOSVD and the orbit properties of each model series are written into separate .npz files,
    and the summary of all models (grid of parameters and chi2 values) are stored in a single file
    results***.txt (*** is either GH or Hist).
    For each series of models with a given potential, the one with a M/L that gives the lowest chi2
    is converted into an N-body representation and written into a separate text file.
    The true value of Mbh is 1e8, and M/L is 1; it makes sense to explore at least a few series of
    models with Mbh ranging from 0 to ~3-5 times the true value.

4.  Finally, one may explore the grid of models for all values of Mbh and M/L by running
    example_forstand.py do=plot [hist=... and other params]

When adapting this script to a particular galaxy with existing observational datasets,
start from step 4 (to make sure that the observed kinematic maps look reasonable and
geometric parameters of the model, such as viewing angles and grids, are correct),
and then go back to step 3 (run several series of models) before going to step 4 again.

This script is mainly tailored to axisymmetric systems, although the Forstand code is applicable
in a more general context (e.g., to rotating triaxial barred galaxies).
The main limitation is the lack of suitable deprojection methods: in this example we use
the Multi-Gaussian expansion to fit the 2d surface density profile of the N-body snapshot
and then deproject it into an ellipsoidally stratified 3d density profile.
In the case of triaxial systems, especially with radially varying axis ratios, this procedure
is much less reliable and may even fail to produce a reasonable deprojection if the actual
3d shape is not well described by ellipsoids.
For triaxial systems, there are two rather than one angle specifying the orientation:
inclination (beta) and the angle alpha between the major axis and the line of nodes,
and in the rotating case, the pattern speed Omega is also a free parameter.

The model parameters and corresponding chi^2 values are stored in a single file
resultsGH.txt (for Gauss-Hermite parametrization of the LOSVD) or
resultsHist.txt (for histograms), and the kinematic maps and orbit distribution of each series
of models with the same potential and varying M/L are stored in a separate .npz archive.
In the interactive plotting regime, the likelihood surface is shown as a function of two
model parameters (in this example, Mbh and M/L), but one may choose another pair of parameters
by providing different columns of the results file as "aval", "bval" arguments for
agama.schwarzlib.runPlot(...); the values of remaining parameters should then be fixed and
specified as command-line arguments.
