This is the action-based galaxy modelling framework. To get it working on your computer:

1.  Download the repository (will download as a tarball).
2a. Install the required libraries (presently only GSL: 
2b. Although not compulsory, you may want to download and install optional libraries:
    - UNSIO library for reading/writing N-body snapshots in various formats: http://projets.lam.fr/projects/unsio
    (without it only the text format is supported).
    - Cuba library for multidimensional integration (the alternative is Cubature library that is bundled with this 
    distribution): http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/
    - galpy - this distribution contains a module for galpy, that can be used instead of its built-in potentials,
    orbit integration and action-finding routines.
Note: to use the Python extension, any external libraries to be statically linked with it need to be compiled with
    -fPIC flag.
3.  You need to create a file called Makefile.local, which is included by the Makefile and contains path names
    and compiler flags specific to your own computer.
    An example is given below (you will need to change the pathnames).
4.  In order to make the Python extension available for import, it should be either copied to its site-packages 
    folder, or the path to it be added to PYTHONPATH environment variable, as shown in the example below.
    To make it permanently available, you may add this line to .bashrc or its analog.
5.  Typing make compiles everything.

Makefile.local (copy and paste everything below into your file and change where required)
